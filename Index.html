        <h3>Welcome to Your Treatment...</h3>
        <p>A psychological visual novel that explores the fragile boundary between reality and delusion. You wake up in a peaceful literary club, but something feels deeply wrong. The medicine makes you drowsy, the memories don't add up, and the staff's smiles seem too perfect.</p>
        <p>As you navigate this seemingly ideal world, you'll uncover disturbing truths about your own mind. The club members aren't who they appear to be, and the poetry holds secrets about your diagnosis. Each day brings you closer to the terrifying reality: this isn't a club - it's Room 404 of a psychiatric hospital.</p>
        <p>Will you embrace the comforting lies or confront the painful truth? Your sanity depends on the choice.</p>
